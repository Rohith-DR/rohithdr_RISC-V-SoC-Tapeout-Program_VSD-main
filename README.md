## 📖 About This Repository
This repo is my personal log of the **VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**.  
It captures each week’s activities, tasks, and reflections as I work through the complete **RTL-to-GDSII design flow** using only **open-source tools**.  

The program is part of a large-scale Indian initiative with thousands of contributors collaborating to make silicon using the **RISC-V instruction set**.

## 🗓️ Week 0 – Environment Setup

| Task | Details | Completion |
|------|----------|-------------|
| [Task 0](Week0/Task0/README.md) | Installed and validated **Icarus Verilog**, **Yosys**, and **GTKWave** for RTL simulation and synthesis. | ✅ Finished |

### 🔑 Takeaways
- Gained hands-on experience setting up **essential EDA tools**.  
- Understood the workflow requirements for RTL and gate-level design.  
- Verified my setup to ensure smooth progression into advanced stages.
