Welcome ‚Äî this repository captures my hands-on progress through the **SoC Tapeout Program (VSD)**.  
Inside you'll find weekly notes, tasks, and resources that document the design and verification steps taken while learning to build a System-on-Chip using the RISC-V architecture.

## What this repo contains
- A week-by-week log of activities and assignments.
- Example scripts, tool installation notes, and simulation outputs.
- Screenshots and small lab results demonstrating the workflows.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to learn the SoC design flow ‚Äî from RTL development and verification to tapeout-ready preparation ‚Äî and to strengthen practical skills for silicon development.

## Quick start ‚Äî tools used
The environment used in this course commonly includes:
- Icarus Verilog (iverilog) for RTL simulation.
- GTKWave for waveform viewing.
- Standard Linux toolchain (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended).

### Installing GTKWave
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install gtkwave
```

(If you prefer, additional setup notes and screenshots are available inside the Week directories.)
